A gray chair is standing above a white book.
A blue bottle falls onto a soft gray chair but does not shatter.
A vision of a gray chair rises from a green bottle.
A snow-white Barabashka is drinking from a sky-blue bottle.
A worried green mouse drags an unconscious white Barabashka behind a curtain.
