A white Barabashka is hiding from a castle guard into a red bottle.
A gray Barabashka makes a red chair disappear from plain sight.
A green book does not look as healthy food for a fat red mouse.
A shining white bottle and a dark red book are lying on a large wooden table.
A shining red bottle and a glittering blue book look like they are magical.
