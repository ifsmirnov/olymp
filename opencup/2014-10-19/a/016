A green book is reading aloud to a baby red Barabashka.
A green chair has a lively picture of a blue Barabashka on its back.
A red book and a gray bottle argue before a silly-looking teenager.
A white bottle with a miniature red chair instead of a cap stands in a cupboard.
A red book is flying around a green Barabashka who tries to catch it.
