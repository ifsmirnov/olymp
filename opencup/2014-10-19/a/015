A yellow-paged blue book lies on a gray chair.
A white chair catches a green bottle falling from a round wooden table.
A white Barabashka with black hair sits cofmfortably on a green chair.
A white book shut like a trap and caught a gray mouse by the tail.
A gray Barabashka drinks a frothy liquid from a red bottle.
